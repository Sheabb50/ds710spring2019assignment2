    "Buying a house is one of the biggest financial transactions that many people ever undertake.  Even a small difference in interest rates or monthly payments can make a large difference in how much you ultimately pay for your mortgage.  However, these details are often buried in masses of paperwork--so it pays to be able to calculate the long-term cost of a mortgage yourself.\n",

Every month, the amount you owe (the balance) first increases due to interest:  1/12 of the interest rate times the current balance.  Then the balance decreases due to your monthly payment.\n",

In the first month, the interest increases the balance by $\\$416.67$, and then your payment reduces it by $\\$500$, for a remaining balance of $\\$99,916.67$.  In the second month, the interest charge is $\\$416.32$, and the remaining balance is \n",

    "3.  If the monthly payment is too small, the balance will go up every month!  \n",
    "  * If this happens, the program should stop and display an appropriate error message.  \n",
    "  * Manually stopping your code in this case is not considered a solution -- your *submitted* code must detect the problem itself, and not enter an infinite loop.\n",
    "4.  If you accidentally create an infinite loop during development and testing, interrupt or restart the kernel.  See the `Kernel` menu up top.\n",
    "5.  Use the modulus or $\\%$  operator to separate the years and months.\n",
    "6.  Your program should only display the columns requested, and the rows should be formatted to appear under the appropriate heading.\n",
    "7.  Because this is an iPython notebook, which is inherently interactive, don't use the `input` function to make your code interactive.  Instead, set the values of the input (such as the interest rate) as variables defined at the top of your code.  Alternatively, if you write one or more functions, you can set the input as the arguments of your function(s).\n"

    "#The mortgage calculator runs in a loop to calculate each step of the \"pay-down\" process.  At each step, amount of monthly interest is being calculated, added to the monthly balance, and then the monthly payment is subtracted from that amount.  As such, Python is keeping track of the monthy balance after these equations are completed, then repeating the process for each row down until it reaches the principal amount that is less than the scheduled payment amount.  At that point, Python is changing the schduled payment amount to match the remaining balance so that the final outcome is a $0 balance (thereby ending the loop)."
